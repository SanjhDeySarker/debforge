# debforge
DebForge is a lightweight C++17 CLI tool that converts compiled binaries into Linux .deb installer packages.  It supports both interactive prompts and CI/CD-friendly command-line flags, with optional preinst/postinst  scripts for production-ready deployments. Future versions aim to extend support to .rpm, Windows, and macOS installers.
